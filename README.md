## Usage

> Some usage instructions

1. Run 'npm install' from the root. This installs the necessary dependencies for the service to run.
1. Run 'npm run build' from the root. This will bundle the React components into a single file that is run as a script from the index.html file. This ensures that service can be run in older browsers.
1. Run 'npm run init_db' from the root. This will create the database and tables this service relies on and seed the tables with some example data.
1. Run 'npm start' from the root. This will start the server on port 3001, and the server will respond to a request to root by serving up a static file--the index.html that runs our bundle created in step 2.
